# ToDo-using-fetch-api
This To-Do List application is designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Bootstrap for responsive design. Here are some key features of the app:

Task Management: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks when they are no longer needed.

Local Storage: The app leverages the browser's local storage to save tasks, ensuring that the user's data persists even when the page is refreshed or closed. This provides a seamless experience where users can return to their list without losing any entries.

Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap, the app is fully responsive, making it accessible on various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal usability.

Reusable Components: To reduce code repetition, the app uses JavaScript's Fetch API to load common components like the header, navbar, and footer dynamically. This approach makes it easier to maintain and update the application.
